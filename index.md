### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite because this was one of the moments that I felt strongest with collaborating and problem solving. I enjoyed being able to make an interactive game that had conditions. It showed me new insight of how simple games like the hi-lo game works through coding.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 was also a favorite because I was able to create a program that could print random words. I found it interesting how the program was able to consider some conditions and look through the dictionary file to comply to these requirements. It felt like a complicated task that I was able to solve.

* Lab 10
    
    Lab 10, part 1 was one of my favorites as well because I was able to create a program that did math equations. I learned how to create a code that found the area of a rectangle which was enjoyable. I liked learning how to use arguments in this program as well.
